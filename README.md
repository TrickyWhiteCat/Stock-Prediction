### Project descriptions
In this projects, we utilize different models to predict the trend of the price of some of the most well known stocks. These models include an LSTM model, a K - Nearest Neighbors Classifier and a Random Forest Classifier.
### Required packages
In this project, we use `numpy`, `pandas`, `torch`, `keras`, `tensorflow`, `tqdm`, `scikit-learn`, `matplotlib` and `seaborn` packages. To run the models, these packages are required to be installed.
### Usage
Each model can be found on the corresponding directory. The LSTM model and Random Forest Classifer are packaged inside an `ipynb` file and can easily run using Jupyter Notebook. The KNN model requires running the `main.py` script in the corresponding directory.
